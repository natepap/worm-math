Java library for handling cellular allometric growth analysis in MatLab

v 1.4 is built to parse data from an Excel file, organize and assign BinaryCellNames and perform some cellular allometric growth analysis
i.e. count the number of concurrently living cells and the number of concurrently living cells in descended from a common ancestor

in future versions, it will be more optimized to work with a microscope running MatLab analysis, and will be used as an additional library
to provide more functionality
